# hwid-activation

A .bat file that activates Windows 10/11 Pro (from Home, Pro, or almost any other edition), permanently.

## Instructions

1. [Download](https://github.com/shaunbharat/hwid-activation/releases/latest/download/activate.bat) the .bat file from the latest release.

2. Run the .bat file as administrator, or accept the UAC prompt.

3. Press enter to continue.

4. Wait for the activation to complete. You won't need to interact with the script again.

> **Note**
> Downloading the .bat file and running it might give you a virus warning or prevent you from running it. That is a false positive. If this happens, you can easily get past it by manually copying the script, pasting it into a new .bat file, and running that instead.
